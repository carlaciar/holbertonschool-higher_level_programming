# Python - Everything is object

![Everything is an object](pythonobject.png)

An object in Python is like a container that holds data and knows how it behaves. It's been interesting to see how Python works, and how it handles objects in memory. I now have an understanding of how everything in Python is an object. Rather than variables storing values, it actually points to the object in memory as a reference. Every list, string, number, and even functions themselves live in memory as objects that code interacts with. Understanding this idea has helped me see how variables, references, and object behaviour actually work behind the scenes.
